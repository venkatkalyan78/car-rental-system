Explore the world of car rentals with the Car Rental System, a Java-based console application that combines learning and simulation. 🌟

Features
🚀 Rent a Car:Experience the ease of renting cars through an interactive console. 🔁 Return a Car: Effortlessly return previously rented cars and update availability. 👥 Customer Management: Add new customers and maintain customer records. 🚗 Car Management: Manage cars, brands, models, and pricing details. 📝 Rental History: Keep track of rentals, customers, and rental durations.


This Car Rental System project is a simple Java application that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It allows users to rent and return cars using a menu-driven console-based system.

--> Demonstrates a real-world application of OOP.
--> Implements Encapsulation (data hiding), Abstraction (simplifies rental process), and basic Polymorphism potential.
--> Uses Collections (ArrayList) to manage cars and rentals dynamically.
--> Implements a menu-driven program using loops and conditional statements.

OOP Concepts Used in This Project
1. Encapsulation (Data Hiding)
--> Private fields (e.g., carId, brand, model in Car class) restrict direct access.
--> Public getter and setter methods provide controlled access to private fields.
2. Abstraction (Hiding Complexity)
--> The Car, Customer, and Rental classes abstract details about cars, customers, and rental processes.
--> The CarRentalSystem class provides a high-level interface for renting and returning cars.
